\----   Nmap Automation - Running in Kali Machine   ----/

For four different products that runs on Kali linux, the script automatically scans the ip address
and stores the scanned reports in both local folder and also in kali root folder. Refer the datafile
for editing folder names, host ip address, password, port and username. 

1. Open the .py files whose name ends with "Scan" and run them in any python editor (I used 
Sublime Text).
2. To run the automation in RIDE framework or any other robot supporting IDLE, open the .robot 
file in any IDLE.
3. Run the check_nmap.py file to check the latest nmap version, if latest version is not found, this
file will install the latest version in respective IP.
4. Run the codes and check reports at corresponding folder to get results.
